# Sugarcane Production Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sugarcane production across various countries. The analysis was conducted using a dataset that captures information such as production, yield, and acreage of sugarcane by country.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:
- **Country**: The country where the sugarcane is produced.
- **Continent**: The continent to which the country belongs.
- **Production (Tons)**: The total sugarcane production in tons.
- **Production per Person (Kg)**: Sugarcane production per person in kilograms.
- **Acreage (Hectare)**: The total area used for sugarcane cultivation in hectares.
- **Yield (Kg / Hectare)**: Sugarcane yield per hectare.

## Analysis Highlights
The main goals of this analysis include:
- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to handle inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various visualizations were generated to explore trends in sugarcane production, yield, and acreage across different countries.
- **Country-wise Insights**: The analysis provides insights into the top sugarcane-producing countries and how production varies by continent.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to highlight key insights such as:
- Distribution of sugarcane production across countries and continents.
- Relationship between production, yield, and acreage.
- Country-wise comparison of production per person.

## Tools Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Seaborn and Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To perform the analysis interactively.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of sugarcane production across the globe, offering insights into production patterns, key countries, and yield metrics.
